# Ludopop

Ludopop is a site build using [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) theme for Jekyll.

I created it to have a small repertoire of ideas worth to be written and shared, in an archive better organized for reference, modularity, and growth; than the usual private blog plattforms.

Contents are writen using Markdown, and I expect to share some assets in LaTeX.
