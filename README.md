# Ludopop

Ludopop is a site built using the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) theme for Jekyll.

I created it to have a small repertoire of ideas worth writing and sharing, in an archive better organized for reference, modularity, and growth than the usual private blog platforms.

Content is written using Markdown, and I expect to share some assets in LaTeX.
