# The Land Around

The Land Around is a role-playing game set in the southern Mapuche territory during the Spanish conquest. It covers the period from 1598 to 1656, spanning from the great Mapuche rebellion to the transformation of frontier relationships.

At that time, Mapuche society thrived between navigable rivers and across vast landscapes. They lived in extended families governed by the father, and mingled with neighboring kin, with whom they shared stories and knowledge.

The core gameplay loop integrates:
- fluid and visceral skirmishes;
- a shifting political landscape;
- gathering, crafting and trade.

Players take on the roles of skilled envoys who assist leaders in critical tasks as they traverse harsh terrain. Their abilities evolve along the paths of the warrior, wisdom, and nature.
