# Activities
Wanderers perform Activities to pursue their goals. Activities are divided into two categories:
- Undertakings, carried out in the wilderness;
- Endeavors, carried out within settlements.

## Undertakings
Undertakings are activities performed in the wild, focused on travel, survival, and dealing with the hazards of the land.

Referee should call an Undertaking roll, when a Wanderer is trying something very risky, with a low chance of being succesful. Player rolls d6 and if the result is equal to, or less than the Undertaking score, the action is successful.

Undertakings have a score of 1. They can be improved with Experience.

### Foraging
Securing food and basic materials from the environment: hunting and trapping animals, gathering edible plants and herbs, and finding drinkable water and usable wood.

### Foresight
Anticipating future events by reading natural and supernatural signs: observing weather patterns, interpreting omens, and sensing impending danger or opportunity.

### Rivercraft
Traveling and working on rivers using small watercraft: paddling, maneuvering currents, navigating rapids, and safely crossing waterways.

### Scavenging
Locating and collecting raw natural materials: stone, clay, minerals, pigments, and other surface resources useful for tools, construction, or trade.

### Sheltercraft
Establishing safety in the wild: building shelters, making and maintaining fire, and providing basic field care for wounds and exhaustion.

### Trailblazing
Finding and creating routes through wilderness: navigating unfamiliar terrain, marking paths, mapping the land, and identifying safe or efficient passages.

### Watch
Keeping watch for threats and signs while traveling or resting: spotting ambushes, noticing disturbances, and detecting traps or hidden dangers.

## Endeavors
When interacting within a settlement, Wanderers may devote their time to different endeavors.

Endeavors success depends on settlement hospitality towards Wanderers. Use the Reaction table to evaluate if the desired actions are permited in that place.

Each Wanderer may choose one Endeavor, then roll 2d6 + PRE:

| **Roll** | **Reaction** | **Settlement…**                    |
|:--------:|:------------:|------------------------------------|
|     2    |    Hostile   | Attacks the Wanderer.              |
|    3–5   |  Unfriendly  | Refuses to colaborate.             |
|    6–8   |  Indifferent | Offers a fair deal.                |
|   9–11   |   Talkative  | Offers a generous deal.            |
|    12    |    Helpful   | Provides unconditional assistance. |

Modify results comparing Settlement and Wanderer Aligments: Equal (+2), Different (–2), Opposite (–4).

Endeavors also requiere time to complete.

### Handicraft
Shaping raw materials into useful tools or art: forging weapons, repairing gear, weaving textiles, and other skilled manual work.

### Inquiry
Uncovering knowledge and secrets by studying vestiges, asking questions, gathering rumors, and piecing together information.

### Mending
Restoring health and vitality: treating wounds, easing fatigue or trauma, brewing remedies, and guiding recovery.

### Parleying
Using dialogue to resolve disputes or gain favor: negotiation, diplomacy, persuasion, and formal oratory.

### Performing
Entertaining or inspiring others through public display: storytelling, music, dance, sport, and communal performance.

### Tending
Nurturing the well-being of people, animals, and places: caring for others, feeding livestock, maintaining dwellings, and preserving sacred sites.

### Trading
